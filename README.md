## React Sandbox

A playground for React development. Uses Webpack to transpile ES6 code and SASS stylesheets.

All the files required in app.jsx and its dependencies are transpiled into bundle.js.


## Usage 

Entry point is src/app.jsx 


```
npm install
```

To run a dev server with live reloading :

```
 npm run watch
```

Then open http://localhost:8080/webpack-dev-server for hot mode indication 
or just http://localhost:8080
